SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.

Squidward: Okay, I’ll bite. What is it, SpongeBob?

SpongeBob: Do you know what today is?

Squidward: Annoy Squidward Day?

SpongeBob: (laughs) No silly! (gets out a calendar) That’s on the 15th! (day is marked by a picture of Squidward’s head) Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month.

Squidward: SpongeBob, don’t you know that award's a scam?

SpongeBob: What do you mean?

Squidward: Mr. Krabs gives you that award so you'll work harder for no extra money.

SpongeBob: That is not true, Squidward. He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too if you tried harder.

Squidward: Oh, for what? To get my face on the Wall of Shame? (shows wall full of SpongeBob pictures for being Employee of the Month)

SpongeBob: Squidward, you’ve got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it’s the only thing that makes it all worth while.

Mr. Krabs: Thattaboy, SpongeBob! This one's gonna be a tough one though! There’s no clear cut winner! (whispering) Watch out, SpongeBob. Squidward appears to be on the verge of a breakout. (shows Squidward reading a magazine) There might be a new face on the wall this month.

SpongeBob: Huh? (looks over and sees the month of “January” with no picture)

Squidward: That’s right, SpongeBob. I might sneak up on you. (Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh at SpongeBob as he walks over to the wall and imagines Squidward laughing at him in the picture)

SpongeBob: No! (begins to cry) How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much! (Squidward's picture continues to laugh. Scene goes to SpongeBob grilling and flipping patties until he comes to a patty that won’t flip and he tries and tries then he flips the patty on the ceiling and tries to get it off of there and Squidward peeks in)

Squidward: Need some help? (SpongeBob screams) What are you doing?

SpongeBob: Making...Krabby Patties?

Squidward: You’re losing it! Don’t you know that award is a load of... (SpongeBob gets the patty off the ceiling but he flings it into the fan and it sprays Squidward with all the meat)...garbage.

SpongeBob: (jumps off of ceiling) Please don’t tell Mr. Krabs about this! It’ll hurt my chances of winning the award!

Squidward: I already told you, that award is a bunch of... (sprayed with meat again)...baloney!

SpongeBob: That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of...

Squidward: (grabs SpongeBob’s hat) It’s a symbol that you’re a chump! (SpongeBob screams)

SpongeBob: No, Squidward!

Squidward: And this is a symbol of what I think of the ‘Employee of the Month’ award! (Squidward lifts his foot and tries to stomp the hat flat but his foot hits something that is under the hat and SpongeBob reveals the stick of lead under it)

SpongeBob: An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat.

Squidward: I’m telling you for the last time, that award is nothing but a joke! (Squidward walks away but is sprayed with meat for the last time. Then we see SpongeBob looking at all his award photos)

SpongeBob: What if Squidward’s right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless! (every award photo now has an army hat on)

SpongeBob Picture: Stall that kind of talk, sailor! This is war now, private! That’s exactly what he wants you to think! This is no time to go lily-livered on us!

SpongeBob: But, sir…

SpongeBob Picture: There’s no room for 'buts' in war, soldier! He wants you to crack! He’s trying to trick you, get inside your mind! You will stop at nothing, and I mean nothing to defeat him! Have I made myself clear, private?

SpongeBob: Crystal, sir!

SpongeBob Picture: Good! Now move out! (SpongeBob marches away and then we see SpongeBob looking through his windows through binoculars while Squidward gets ready for bed)

SpongeBob: I won’t let Squidward win! (Squidward sets his alarm and walks off) He can’t go to work if he doesn’t wake up. Target sited. (SpongeBob sneaks up to Squidward’s house by sliding on the ground then through one of Squidward’s windows and as he enters he falls to the ground and Squidward’s hears the noise while he is brushing his teeth. Squidward goes to check what it is and SpongeBob is standing behind the plant by the door. Squidward closes the door and SpongeBob slides around the door and then by Squidward’s bed where the alarm clock is. He is about to grab it when he hears the door handle jiggle so he hides in the pillow on the bed. Squidward gets into bed and isn’t comfortable with the pillow as it is so he adjusts it. Tries to adjust it again and you can hear SpongeBob’s giggling. Squidward lays his head down and SpongeBob’s hand reaches out for the clock and Squidward see it. Squidward freaks out and throws the pillow again the wall. The cover comes down and you can see SpongeBob)

Squidward: SpongeBob? What are you doing here? (SpongeBob grabs alarm clock)

SpongeBob: You can’t win that award if you don’t get up for work! (SpongeBob destroys the clock. Squidward has another one he is setting while he is laughing. SpongeBob grabs that one and destroys it while Squidward opens up a closet full of alarm clocks with SpongeBob destroying some of them one by one)

Squidward: Stop it, SpongeBob! If I really wanted that award, I could win it with my tentacles tied!

SpongeBob: That can be arranged.

Squidward: You’re a lunatic, SpongeBob!

SpongeBob: Maybe so, but I did win ‘Employee of the Month’ 26 times in a row.

Squidward: (screams) Are you trying to say that you are better than me?!

SpongeBob: I’ve been better than you 26 months in a row and it’ll be 27 tomorrow.

Squidward: Oh, that’s it, square-for-brains! That’s it! I’m going to show you how easy it is to win that award. I’m going to be the new ‘Employee of the Month’! I will prove to you that I am far more competent than you!

SpongeBob: Well, I’m going in early to wax the floors!

Squidward: Don’t bother; I’ll have done it already by the time you get there!

SpongeBob: Well, you’ll have to get there pretty early to get there before me!

Squidward: I don’t need to sleep! Loser!

SpongeBob: Well, me neither! …26-time loser! (SpongeBob and Squidward are watching each other through their window) Look at him. Watchin’ me.

Squidward: I’m watching you, SpongeBob. You’re not leaving before me.

SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, getting sleepy huh?

Squidward: No, how about you?

SpongeBob: No! (Squidward gets out his clarinet and plays “Go To Sleep” lullaby and puts SpongeBob to sleep.) Nighty night. (Squidward tries to walk out but falls in a very deep square hole dug up by SpongeBob right in front of his door)

Squidward: SpongeBob! (SpongeBob comes up with a shovel in his hand)

SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Going somewhere?

Squidward: I’m going to wring you dry when I get out of here! Now get me out of here!

SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, I’ll stop by after work! [Squid screams some more. Sponge walks back to bed] Now to get some rest. Don’t want to look tired for my ‘Employee of the Month’ photo! (SpongeBob goes to his bed and sleeps a while till Squidward gets out the hole) Squidward! (Squidward is nailing boards onto SpongeBob’s front door)

Squidward: That oughta hold him. (SpongeBob saws around it and pushes the door on Squidward and runs away. A cage drops enclosing SpongeBob and Squidward laughs. SpongeBob slides out because he can fit through the bars)

Squidward: SpongeBob! Why you little…! (SpongeBob writes “loser.” on the bottle with his finger in a script writing and runs away. Later he sees a krabby patty)

SpongeBob: Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty! (smells it but the top bun opens up and a claw comes out grabbing SpongeBob’s nose) Aah! Squidwaaaard!

Squidward: So long, sponge loser! (Squidward gets caught in a net and SpongeBob runs by laughing. SpongeBob runs through a barbed-wire fence and Squidward runs by laughing. Squidward is tied by his tentacles and SpongeBob runs by laughing. SpongeBob is stuck in a brick wall and Squidward runs by laughing. Later the two are trying to drag along some big items. SpongeBob is dragging an anchor and Squidward is dragging a flaming boat) SpongeBob? Truce? (both wave a white flag)

SpongeBob: Truce.

Squidward: SpongeBob, I can’t take it anymore. If we keep this up, neither of us will win the award!

SpongeBob: You’re right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it. (its now dawn)

Squidward: Ok, let’s have a good clean fight.

SpongeBob: And may the better man win. (shakes hands with Squidward) He’s nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!

Squidward: Look at that buck-toothed, corn-fed smile. You can’t trust him as far as you can throw him.

SpongeBob: As soon as he stops shaking my hand...

Squidward: ...I’m gonna make a run for it. (SpongeBob and Squidward stop shaking hands, laugh nervously, and run for the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is opening it up)

Mr. Krabs: Money, money, gonna make some money! (sees SpongeBob and Squidward come running over) Ah, it warms me wallet to see me employees coming in so early. Boys, you’re early! (Mr. Krabs realizes that they aren’t stopping for anything) Wait! (both push Mr. Krabs out of the way and start doing nice stuff)

SpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs! Clean floors!

Squidward: Clean tables, Mr. Krabs! (Squidward presses too hard on the table while he is cleaning and breaks it in half)

SpongeBob: Clean dishes, Mr. Krabs!

Mr. Krabs: What’s going on here?! (SpongeBob drops and breaks the dishes and mops them just like that)

SpongeBob: It’s much more efficient to clean dishes this way, Mr. Krabs!

Mr. Krabs: No!

Squidward: Flowers and chocolate for you, Mr. Krabs?

SpongeBob: Look, I’m putting my own money into the register, Mr. Krabs! (SpongeBob puts his money into the register)(Squidward and SpongeBob are in the kitchen) Two spatulas to increase productivity, Mr. Krabs! Faster, SpongeBob, faster!

Squidward: There’s nothing to this patty flipping, Mr. Krabs! I’ll easily double your output, sponge-cog! (both make many patties to overflow the Krusty Krab to where it explodes)

Mr. Krabs: Boys, boys, boys! That's enough....Help! (exploding)

Citizens: Hey, free Krabby Patties! Hey, look at that! Free Krabby Patties! (While the Krabby Patties fall from the sky, Mr. Krabs head is broken through one of SpongeBob’s employee pictures)

Mr. Krabs: Wait, wait, you’ve got to pay for those! Wait, wait, wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties! Boys, wait!(SpongeBob and Squidward come through the picture frame that Mr. Krabs is in and asks his who is the winner and Mr. Krabs is still arguing about the Krabby Patties)

Narrator: Mrs. Puff’s Boating School. Where diligent students learn the rules of the road.

Mrs. Puff: Everyone, put down your books, because it’s time to pick out the hall monitor of the day! (SpongeBob squeezes his pencil so hard it shoots up into the air) Let’s see here. This week's hall monitor will be Bart, Jimmy, no, no, Tina, Ralph, mm... (gasps) ...SpongeBob. (SpongeBob moves his desk between 2 rows) It's Jimmy! Jimmy’s the hall monitor.

Jimmy: Mrs. Puff, I’ve done it already! (SpongeBob moves his desk closer)

Mrs. Puff: Ohh...Phil?

Phil: No way, Mrs. Puff. (SpongeBob moves his desk closer)

Mrs. Puff: Uhh, Tina, you’re the hall monitor.

Tina: Hey, I’ve done it three times already! (SpongeBob moves up closer)

Mrs. Puff: B-B-Beth!

Student: She graduated!

Mrs. Puff: Henry? (SpongeBob moves closer) Vera? (SpongeBob moves closer) Clayton? (SpongeBob is poking Mrs. Puff with his desk as she sighs) Alright, I guess I have no choice. (gulps) The hall monitor of the day is SpongeBob. (SpongeBob launches into the air)

SpongeBob: Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma’am! I am ready to assume my position...in the hall! I will protect all that are weak...in the hall! All rules will be enforced...in the hall!

Mrs. Puff: Ok! Just take the hat and belt. (tries handing him uniform)

SpongeBob: I can’t except that yet, ma’am. First I have to make my speech.

Mrs. Puff: You can’t make this easy, can you?

SpongeBob: Classmates!! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff.

Mrs. Puff: Give me a break.

SpongeBob: And to my public, all I can say is I’m touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties... (clock moves forward in time as SpongeBob continues his speech) ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall! (at this point, everyone is almost asleep) Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time. (takes out a long roll of paper) “Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears.” (the clock has disappeared, and it is now much later in the day. Puff is asleep at her desk) In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform (takes out the hat and belt) and assume my duties as... (puts on the uniform) ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff! (walks towards the door then turns around) Oh, and I will be... (bell rings as all students run over SpongeBob)

Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, are you ok?

SpongeBob: I overdid the speech again, didn’t I?

Mrs. Puff: I’m afraid so.

SpongeBob: Aww, tarter sauce. I guess I won’t be needing this. (takes off his uniform) I hardly knew ya. (gives uniform to Mrs. Puff and walks away saddened)

Mrs. Puff: Uhh...SpongeBob?

SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff?

Mrs. Puff: I can at least let you wear it until tomorrow.

SpongeBob: A-hoo! (dives into the uniform) Thanks, Mrs. Puff!

Mrs. Puff: What are the consequences of what I’ve just done? (cut to SpongeBob walking down the street. Then notices a broken traffic light)

SpongeBob: Broken traffic light! Who’s to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I could be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor! (directs traffic, with a whistle, to their destination using all sorts of hand gestures but ends up causing a huge wreck in the end) What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?

Fred: My leg! My leg.

SpongeBob: On patrol. I’m on patrol. (notices a house with an open window) Uh-oh, an open window. (peeks through the window and there is a couple eating) Woman: More seaweed medley, dear?

SpongeBob: The fools. They’ve left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example. (jumps through the window and onto their table in a ski mask) I’m the open window maniac! (both run out screaming) I hope you’ve learned a valuable lesson! (shuts the window and begins walking again) On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol... (gasps as he sees a puddle of pink goo on the ground) Vandals! Another crime. (takes his finger and tastes the pink goo) Strawberry. I must act! (more pink goo falls on his head. He looks up and sees Patrick eating some strawberry ice cream) Patrick... (looks around for the voice he just heard) Patrick... Patrick...

Patrick: My ice cream! It’s alive! (screams and throws away the ice cream)

SpongeBob: Patrick! Down here!

Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, it’s you. (ice cream cone is on SpongeBob’s face)

SpongeBob: Patrick. Come down here. (Patrick jumps down on top of SpongeBob)

Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob?

SpongeBob: I’m down here.

Patrick: Hehe, you look funny! Hi, SpongeBob.

SpongeBob: That’s hall monitor to you!

Patrick: Sorry, officer.

SpongeBob: Sorry’s not good enough, Patrick. You’ve committed a crime, and I’m taking you in.

Patrick: What crime? (shows him the ice cream that is on the ground) I’m a bad person! (cries)

Paperboy: Extra! Extra! Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom! City paralyzed with fear! (gives one to SpongeBob) Take it, friends. Arm yourselves with knowledge. (runs off) Extra! Extra!

SpongeBob: (reads paper) Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wreck? Break-in? Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can’t handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?

Patrick: (still crying) I wanna be good!

SpongeBob: Hmmm...now you just need a symbol of authority. (Patrick puts the ice cream cone on his head) Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you’re an ex-criminal. What would you do?

Patrick: Hmmm...I’d get an ice cream! (both walk out an ice cream store with ice cream)

SpongeBob: Ok, now what?

Patrick: Hmmm... (both come out the ice cream store again with ice cream)

SpongeBob: This isn't working. We’ve got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies! (takes out two walkie-talkies. Patrick grabs one and is elated with joy) And now, duty calls! Alright deputy, I’ll go that way, you go some different way! Run 'em out! (SpongeBob runs off sounding like a siren. The police come driving up and stop beside Patrick)

Officer Durado: Afternoon, son.

Patrick: Hello, brothers. (salutes to the officers and points to his 'hat')

Officer Durado: Son, we’re looking for the maniac.

Officer Malley: Have you seen this man?! (officer #2 whips out a sign that says 'WANTED MANIAC' with SpongeBob’s picture on it. Patrick screams)

Patrick: It’s the maniac! Take him away! Take him away!

Officer Durado: Calm down son. It’s just a drawing, not the real thing. Now we’re going to show you the picture again, and you tell us if you’ve seen this guy, understand?

Patrick: Yeah, uh-huh.

Officer Durado: Ok. (officer Malley shows Patrick the sign again)

Patrick: (screams) Horrible! (puts picture away. Both officers look at each other and smile. Officer #2 takes away and shows the sign to Patrick as he screams every time.)

Officer Durado: Stay indoors, son.

Officer Malley: And, uhh, take that cone off your head. (both laugh as they drive off)

Patrick: (takes out walkie-talkie) SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer.

SpongeBob: SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report.

Patrick: (over walkie-talkie) I don’t wanna be a policeman anymore! I’m scared!

SpongeBob: Get a hold of yourself deputy.

Patrick: (over walkie-talkie) I wanna go home!

SpongeBob: Poor rookie. Alright, I’m on my way back.

Patrick: Hurry SpongeBob, I think it’s getting... (day becomes night) ...dark.

SpongeBob: Just put on your siren and I’ll be right there.

Patrick: Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. (Patrick picks up the sign that the officers showed him earlier. Then sees a darkish figure down the road. It's SpongeBob but Patrick doesn't realize it) Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him!

SpongeBob: (over walkie-talkie) Where is he, Patrick?

Patrick: (over walkie-talkie) At the intersection of Conch and Coral. (SpongeBob turns his head around to read the street sign)

SpongeBob: That's where I am. He’s right on top of me, but I can’t see him! What’s he doing?

Patrick: Uhh, he’s just standing there...menacingly! (screams over walkie-talkie) Get out of there, SpongeBob! (SpongeBob screams) That’s his maniac screech. He’s going to attack! (SpongeBob runs around in circles) He’s acting all crazy! Run! Hide behind that building! (SpongeBob hides behind the building) No, he’s behind that building! Oh, quick, hide behind that street sign! (SpongeBob hides behind the street sign) No wait! The maniac just went behind that sign! Quick! Get under the street light! (SpongeBob gets under the street lights) No wait, he’s there, too! Run for your life! (SpongeBob jumps inside a mailbox. As he tries to relax, the radio is cutting out)

SpongeBob: (over walkie-talkie) Say again, deputy?

Patrick: The maniac is in the mailbox! (SpongeBob pokes his arms and legs through the mailbox and runs through buildings and a fence)

SpongeBob: (takes a look at the 'wanted' sign) Huh, this guy’s not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick, I’m the maniac! (Patrick screams and a bunch of police cars surround SpongeBob)

Officer Durado: We’ll take that as a confession. (Mrs. Puff appears)

Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob SquarePants, there you are! I turn my back on you for one minute and you destroy half the city! You should be ashamed of yourself!

Officer #1: You know this guy?

Mrs. Puff: Of course I do. I’m the one who gave him the uniform in the first place. He’s my responsibility. (the cops stare at her) Uh-oh... (at the boating school where the whole class, except SpongeBob, is sleeping. Mrs. Puff is teaching class from jail through the TV) Now in conclusion, class: red means stop, green means go. And SpongeBob...

TV Announcer: Mermaid Man: Fleet and forceful. With the ability to assemble and charge the creatures of the deep.
Mermaid Man: By the power of Neptune!

SpongeBob and Patrick: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite!
SpongeBob: Creatures of the deep, assemble! [both go into deep thinking] Think... harder... Barnacle Boy. [jellyfish swims by] Here they come. [Squidward blows jellyfish away]
SpongeBob: Blast, Reflecto has become too powerful.
Squidward: [under a tent] What the? Ohh!
SpongeBob: If Reflecto is cut off from sunlight, he becomes weak.
Patrick: Jumping Jellyfish, Mermaid Man. Hes destroying the shield.
SpongeBob: Quick, Barnacle Boy, back to the sea cave.
Patrick: Right, Mermaid Man.
Squidward: [door knocks] SpongeBob! SpongeBob, open up!
SpongeBob: Reflecto has found our secret lab.
Patrick: What would the real Mermaid Man do?
Squidward: Why don't you go ask him yourself?
SpongeBob: Elaborate, you vile fiend.
Squidward: He and Barnacle Boy live in the retirement home on the other side of town.
SpongeBob: Hmm, they must be working undercover.
Squidward: Yeah... now please leave me alone.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Patrick bites into the donut again] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, reunite! [At Shady Shoals Retirement Home]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, I know that Mermaid Man is working undercover on an important case, but you think we can see him?
Manager: Undercover? Yeah... well, I'll see if they can take time from their busy schedule to see you. [SpongeBob and Patrick laughing as they walk in] There they are. Right over there. [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp]
Manager: Try not to surprise them.
SpongeBob: Patrick! Can you believe it?
Patrick: [holding onto SpongeBob] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the flesh! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk in front of the TV]
Barnacle Boy: Hey, who are those guys?
Mermaid Man: Uhh, are they here to fix the TV?
Barnacle Boy: What do you want?

Mermaid Man: [hanging on a water fountain] EVIL! EVIL, EVIL, EVIL, EVIL, EVIL! [water squirts at him] Disgraaace! [manager comes, grabs and throws SpongeBob and Patrick out]
SpongeBob: Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
Patrick: It's too bad they're old.
SpongeBob: What do you mean, Patrick? Old people are the greatest. They're full of wisdom and experience. [real life captain gives a thumbs up and the Jurassic Park theme plays] The world needs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Someone, somewhere, is in trouble, and I won't rest until Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are out of retirement. [fireworks appear]
Patrick: Ooh! Pretty lights!
[At Shady Shoals Retirement Home's cafeteria]
Mermaid Man: To the meatloaf! To the broccoli! Make sure you give extra broccoli to my young ward. The boy needs his vitamins.
Cafeterian: Here you go, son. Haha.
Mermaid Man: To the table, away!
Barnacle Boy: Careful! Don't run!
SpongeBob: Hey, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: Uh, here comes the TV repairman.
Barnacle Boy: What do you want from us?
SpongeBob: Hold on. Just let me look at ya.
Mermaid Man: Stay alert, Barnacle Boy. He... he's up to something.
Barnacle Boy: Will you cut... will you stop calling me "boy?"
SpongeBob: Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low? So you invented a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens. But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae. [jumps onto one of the cafeteria tables where somebody is eating] And he globs onto the undersea dome. [puts his mouth on the table] And he starts sucking on the glass.
Barnacle Boy: What's your point, kid?
SpongeBob: You guys are the greatest heroes of all time, and I think you should come out of retirement.
Mermaid Man: Listen up, you villains. I wanna eat my meatloaf. If you don't get out of here, then by the power invested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.
Manager: What is going on in here?
Mermaid Man: You may kiss the bride! [SpongeBob gets kicked out and rolls home]
Patrick: Did you re-unite our heroes?
SpongeBob: No, but I'm married. [Back at the retirement home]
Mermaid Man: Up, up, and away. Up, up, and away.
SpongeBob: [dressed up as a woman] Oh, my. This purse is so big and heavy.
Patrick: [dressed up as the bad guy robber] Hold it right there, ma'am. I'll be taking that.
SpongeBob: [screams] Hay-lp! Hay-lp! Hay-lp!
Patrick: It's working.
SpongeBob: [Barnacle Boy comes over to him] Why, are you here to rescue little ol' me?
Barnacle Boy: Pipe down! You could wake Mermaid Man and he's awry when his nap is disturbed.
SpongeBob: Ever alert, Mermaid Man has trained himself to sleep with his eyes open.
Barnacle Boy: Confound it, get away from him!
Mermaid Man: Stop shoutin'. I'm nappin'!
Barnacle Boy: It's not me, you ol' coot!
Retired Elderly #1: Yes.
Retired Elderly #2: That's me.
Retired Elderly #3: I'm over here.
SpongeBob: Excuse me, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: What do you want?
Barnacle Boy: This better be good.
SpongeBob: This'll cheer you up. We're almost done painting your invisible boatmobile. [The invisible boatmobile is shown almost completely covered in black paint and we also see Patrick smiling while holding a paintbrush with black paint on it.]
Barnacle Boy: Gah! It's supposed to be invisible! That's it! We gotta end our life of leisure. Time to come out of retirement. There's evil afoot.
Mermaid Man: EVIL! Where is it?
Barnacle Boy: There it is! [points at SpongeBob and Patrick] You know what this means? [opens up box with shiny rings]
Mermaid Man: Donuts!
Barnacle Boy: Oh, brother. [puts ring on Mermaid Man and then they put them together, but it doesn't work, so they do it again, but it doesn't work] Say the oath.
Mermaid Man: [in his young voice] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, UNITE! [they put the rings together, and this time it works] Throw a waterball at 'em!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Waterballs! Waterballs! [Barnacle Boy throws a waterball at SpongeBob]
Patrick: Hehehehehe.
Barnacle Boy: Mumbling mories. It's not working, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: He-he's-he's absorbing it like some kind of EVIL SPONGE!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Dogpaddle away!
Patrick: It's the Raging Whirlpool. [SpongeBob and Patrick cheer]
Mermaid Man: Those fiends. They're actually enjoying it.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!
Barnacle Boy: Now what, Mermaid Man? We need help!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Sea creatures, unite! [sea creatures are retired so they come slowly]
Barnacle Boy: Hmm, the creatures of the deep seem to have lost some of their luster.
Mermaid Man: Sea creatures, attack! [sea creatures pick up SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: Mission accomplished, Patrick.
Patrick: Yeah, we did it. [sea creatures throw them out]
Mermaid Man: I did it. I feel five years younger. Oh, it's good to be back!
Barnacle Boy: We did it, you ol' coot.
Mermaid Man: Who are you?
TV Announcer: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join our heroes locked in a battle of wits. [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy play checkers when phone rings]
Mermaid Man: It's the Aqua phone! What is it, Chief? Uhh, hello? Hello? Hello? ["HANG UP!" appears] The phone is still broken. Remind me to g-get that fixed. ["SIT!" appears]
Barnacle Boy: Remind you of what?
Mermaid Man: Remind me of what?
TV Announcer: Will our heroes ever get their phone fixed? Tune in next week and find out.
SpongeBob: Wow. That was even better than the old show.
Patrick: All thanks to you.

SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff?

Mrs. Puff: I’d like to see you after class. Six months from now.
